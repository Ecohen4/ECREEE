Welcome ECREEE Fellows!

To get started, you will need access to the tutorials we have prepared for this workshop.  Here are two options:

1.  The easiest way to access and share these tutorials (and the best way to work collaboratively on almost any project!) is through github.com.  If you don't already use github, I suggest the following easy-to-follow tutorial to help you get started.   This will take ~30 minutes.

Assuming that you are now setup with git, github, and have navigated to the project page <https://github.com/Ecohen4/ECREEE> you can "clone" the repository containing the tutorials.  The "clone" button creates a local copy of the github repository on your machine. From the terminal, type:
> git clone "https://github.com/Ecohen4/ECREEE.git"

2. ALTERNATIVELY... skip all that and simply download the tutorials as a ZIP file. 
Go to the following website <https://github.com/Ecohen4/ECREEE> and click "Download ZIP" on the bottom-right of the page.  This avoids getting setup with github altogether and is just like downloading data from anywhere on the web.

After following option 1 **or** 2 from above, you can now load the tutorials in RStudio:
* Open RStudio
* Create a "New Project"  
* Select "Existing Directory"  
* Navigate (e.g. "browse") to the github repository **or** ZIP file that you just created on your machine. 

 [ RStudio > File > New Project > Existing Directory > Browse > ~/ECREEE ]

Then, from the "Files" pane on the bottom right of the RStudio interface, select from the following tutorials:
* ECREEE_R_Training_1.Rmd  
* ECREEE_R_Training_2.Rmd
* NRLDC-Daily.Rmd
