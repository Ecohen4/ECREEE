# Welcome ECREEE Fellows!

### Access Data via Github
To get started, you will need access to the tutorials we have prepared for this workshop.  Here are two options:

**Option 1**: The easiest way to access and share these tutorials (and the best way to work collaboratively on almost any project!) is through github.com.  If you don't already use github, I suggest the following easy-to-follow [tutorial](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1) to help you get started. This will take ~30 minutes.

Assuming that you are now setup with git, github, and have navigated to the [project page](https://github.com/Ecohen4/ECREEE), you can "clone" the repository containing the tutorials.  The "clone" button creates a local copy of the github repository on your machine. From the terminal, type:

	git clone "https://github.com/Ecohen4/ECREEE.git"

**Option 2**: Alternatively, skip all that and simply download the tutorials as a ZIP file. 
Go to the [project page](https://github.com/Ecohen4/ECREEE) and click "Download ZIP" on the bottom-right of the page. This avoids getting setup with github altogether and is just like downloading data from anywhere on the web.

### Load Data in R
After following Option 1 _or_ 2 from above, you can now load the tutorials in RStudio:
	
	RStudio > File > New Project > Existing Directory > Browse > ~/ECREEE

* Open RStudio
* Create a "New Project"
* Select "Existing Directory"
* Navigate to the github repository _or_ ZIP file that you just created.

Then, from the "Files" pane on the bottom right of the RStudio interface, select from the following tutorials:

* ECREEE_R_Training_1.Rmd  (R Basic Training)
* ECREEE_R_Training_2.Rmd (Engineering Analysis with R: A Few Practical Examples)

Now you're all set to get started!
